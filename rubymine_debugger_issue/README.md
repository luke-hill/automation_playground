# RubyMine issues

`api.rb` - Fully working script. Debugging here works fine. I can run passing and failing methods

`mixed.rb` - This script will partially work. It depends on where you debug and which commands you run in debug

`web.rb` - This script completely fails.

## Instructions

For each script. Put a break point on each code execution line. Then run the following commands
- Step through: `Play/Pause`
- In interactive console run the command that you are paused on
- Continue to next step
